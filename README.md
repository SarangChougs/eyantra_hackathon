TITLE OF THE PROJECT : "STHANIK JANKARI"

DESCRIPTION :
"STHANIK JANKARI" is a solution created after the survey and observed senario. As we all know that all the doctors dealing with the corona patients are concerned and working day and night to recover our Nation and the whole World out there. 
But its impossible for them to maintain the data of the all the patients accurately as well as shift of the doctors changes day and night which results in difficult maintainance. And this is what the real senario going outside. 
Also, as we can watch and read on various newspapers that the family members of the corona patients do not get to know the recovery status of them. They just get the final news. 
Considering these two under the few major issues after surveying, we came out with the solution of it.
We have made a website where 
1. Doctors can maintain the record/database of the patient.
2. Patient can create account and can add family members/relatives to get their recovery status at any moment.
3. Suspected patients can even check the testing centres near by to their city.
4. Desirable testing centres are available with their emergency telephone number, Toll-free number, govt. email id.
5. Anyone using the site will be able to see the total number of corona cases in our country, number of patients discharged, Active Foreign cases and Total deaths due to corona.
